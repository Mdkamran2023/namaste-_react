# library
- for specific functionality(controls are given to developers),u are making a call to library--jquery,reactjs
# framework
- It provides structure for our applications (predefined--bounded by more rules),framework is just calling to ur code--django,nextjs

[REACT](https://reactjs.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html)

- ReactJS is a javascript library for building user interfaces. It's not a framework.
- A library is basically used to solve some common problems, we don't have to write code in Vanilla JS that is pure JS that could be somewhat challenging for people.
- That means, in order to build complete React applications, you will need to choose the packages and tools on your own.
- While Angular is usually considered a framework as it provides strong opinions on how your application should be structured.

 1. React has reusable components: Code re-use helps make your apps easier to develop and easier to maintain. They also help you implement a consistent look and feel across the whole project.
 2.  React improves performance due to VDOM.



- React is the view part of the MVC framework..

- How is real DOM different from Virtual DOM?
- Manipulating the real DOM is slow.Manipulating the VDOM is much faster
- A Virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object (like a lightweight copy.)


- ReactJS is not a framework, as it does not provide a complete solution for building web applications.
-  Instead, it is often used in conjunction with other libraries to render to certain environments .
-  For example, Next.js and Remix are full-stack React frameworks that can be used to build entire applications with React.
